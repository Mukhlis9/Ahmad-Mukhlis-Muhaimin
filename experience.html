<h2><font size="16">Working at hotel</font></h2>
<br>
<font size="5">I was once working at a hotel named Hotel Kamelia, in Bertam. 
At that time i work during semester break, and the reason i work there is that so i can get an experience. 
I worked there as a front officer and during the time when i worked there, i can say that i has faced many things, 
especially as someone who have to face various kind of customers when they come to book a room in the hotel. 
Not to mention as a front officer, we have to deal with the unsatisfied customer and whatever they wants to complain. 
From my point of view this role takes me to learn that it is not an easy task and i need to be patient and 
have a strong mind to face many kinds of customer. To be honest, i myself can't believe that i managed to work there for some time. </font>
